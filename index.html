							<p>In my senior year in college, my team won 3rd place out of 40 applicant startup teams in a national startup competition.</p>
							<p>The idea was to create a WebApp that connect musicians with establishments that needed performances. I organized the team as a CEO and pitched our final presentation.</p>
							<p>I like this project because it highlights my communication and leadership skills. This taught me a lot about Agile and Product Ownership. <a target="_blank" href="./resources/SoundTrip Presentation Deck.pdf">See the whole presentation.</a></p>

							<p>In this project, I scraped, cleaned, and analyzed over 7,000 tweets over 3 months about Toxic Masculinity.
