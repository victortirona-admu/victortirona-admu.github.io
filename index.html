						<div class = "FP-body">
							<p>This project was an exercise with computer vision and digital signal processing. It takes in a picture of a parking lot, detects how many total parking slots there are, and which ones are occupied.</p>
							<p>While most computer vision projects would be built on OpenCV, all the grayscaling, binarization, and image transformation functions used in this project were built from scratch.</p>
							<p>How it works: the software assumes that a stable camera is being pointed at a parking lot. It takes a picture of the parking lot when it's empty and uses this as a reference photo. Everytime a new car appears, the software detects any change in pixels and determines which slots were taken.</p>

						<div class = "WE-line"></div>
						<div class = "FP-body">
							<p>It's a fun fact that the sun flowers follow to face the sun as it moves through out the day. This project aimed to do the same and build a control system where the solar panel is always facing the sun at an optimal angle. It uses two servo motors to change the X and Y rotation of the solar panel and an Arduino to control those fine movements.</p>
							<p>In all honesty, the energy used up in controlling the motors would outweigh the solar energy being collected. But it was a fun proof of concept in any case.</p>
